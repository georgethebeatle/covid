# Covid-19 Playground

This is a jupyter notebook that I use to explore covid-19 data. It uses data from two main sources:
- https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-cases-covid-19: No information about deaths and recoveries
- https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset: Information about confirmed cases, deaths and recoveries
